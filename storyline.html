      Three different actors have portrayed the character, and these different
      Spider-Men have had different supporting characters, villains, and
      storylines. But the Spider-Man we're going to be focusing on is the most
      recent one; the one portrayed by actor Tom Holland.

      This Spider-Man is a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), so he
      routinely interacts with other Marvel characters and is affected by
      storylines that happen in other movies. It's not super necessary to watch
      a ton of the MCU films to know what's going on with Spider-Man's story,
      but some are essential. With that in mind, here are the Tom Holland
      Spider-Man movies in order.
